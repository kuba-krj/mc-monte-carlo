# Monte Carlo methods and stochastic simulations - summer 2021
This repository contains some of the problems that I have solved during the 
course. The areas covered are: generating random variables from discrete/continuous
distributions, generating random processes (especially Markov processes), 
Markov Chain Monte Carlo processes. Formulations of the problems can be found
in the handbook (respective numbers of problems are the names of files).
